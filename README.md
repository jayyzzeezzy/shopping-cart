# The Online Shop

![Demo Screenshot](the-online-shop-readme.PNG)

## Description

The Online Shop captures customerâ€™s demand for each product and displays it in a virtual shopping cart. Customers can also update the quantity of each product after adding it to the cart. This project serves to give a visual representation of backend data, that is transmitted through API. I used [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) in this project.  

Using the web development skills that I learned from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/
), the mundane server-side data is transformed into HTML elements that users can interact with, with a click of a button.
